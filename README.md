### Description
* Genealogy is a browser-based application which makes it easier than ever for you to collect and process genealogical data. It uses a Laravel 10 backend with PHP 8.2 and the Laravel Liberu module collection. 
* You can create a family tree of your own either by importing data in any of several standard formats, or by manually entering the data yourself. 
* We offer full API support for many family tree database and records forms. You can, for example, import and export Gedcom data and DNA matching results. 
* Smart Matching is coming soon â€“ allowing you to connect easily to resources on other servers. 
* Your data is securely stored on our server, and will never leave your environment without your permission. 
* Data tables support comprehensive CRUD information.
* Our forms are easy to modify.
* The client can be found at https://github.com/liberu-ui/genealogy.
